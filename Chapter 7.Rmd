### 7.3
Suppose we fit a curve with basis functions $b_1(X)=X$, $b_2(X)=(X-1)^2I(X>=1)$. (Note that $I(X>=1)$ equals 1 for X>=1 and 0 otherwise.) We fit the linear regression model$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1b_1(X)+\beta_2b_2(X)+\epsilon$, and obtain coefficient estimates $\hat\beta_0=1$,$\hat\beta_1=1$,$\hat\beta_2=-2$. Sketch the estimated curve between X=-2 and X=2. Note the intercepts, slopes and other relevant information.
```{r}
x <- -2:2
y <- 1 + x + -2*(x-1)^2 * I(x>1)
plot(x,y)
```
The curve is linear between-2 and 1: $y=1+x$ and quadratic between 1 and 2:$y=1+x-2(x-1)^2$.
