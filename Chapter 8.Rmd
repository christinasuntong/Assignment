### 8.1
Draw an example (of your own invention) of a partition of two-dimensional feature space that could result from recursive binary splitting. Your example should contain at least six regions. Draw a
decision tree corresponding to this partition. Be sure to label all aspects of your figures, including the regions $R_1$, $R_2$,..., the cutpoints $t_1$, $t_2$,..., and so forth.
Hint: Your result should look something like Figures 8.1 and 8.2.
