### 12.3
In this problem, you will perform K-means clustering manually, with K = 2, on a small example with n = 6 observations and p = 2 features. The observations are as follows.

![my answer](/Users/christinasun/Desktop/MA679/Assignment/12.3.png)
##(a)
Plot the observations.
```{r}
x <- cbind(c(1,1,0,5,6,4), c(4,3,4,1,2,0))
plot(x[,1], x[,2])
```

##(b)
Randomly assign a cluster label to each observation. You can use the sample() command in R to do this. Report the cluster labels for each observation.
```{r}
set.seed(2022)
label <- sample(2, nrow(x), replace = T)
label
```
```{r}
plot(x[, 1], x[, 2], col = (label + 1), pch = 16, cex = 2)
```

##(c)
Compute the centroid for each cluster.
```{r}
centroid_green <- c(mean(x[label == 1, 1]), mean(x[label == 1, 2]))
centroid_red <- c(mean(x[label == 2, 1]), mean(x[label == 2, 2]))
plot(x[,1], x[,2], col = (label + 1), pch = 16, cex = 2)
points(centroid_green[1], centroid_green[2], col = 2, pch = 6)
points(centroid_red[1], centroid_red[2], col = 3, pch = 6)
```
Manually, I compute the centroid for green cluster with $\bar x_{11}=\frac{1}{3}(0+1+4)=\frac{5}{3}$ and $\bar x_{12}=\frac{1}{3}(0+4+4)=\frac{3}{8}$.Also for the red cluster, $\bar x_{21}=\frac{1}{3}(1+5+6)=4$ and $\bar x_{22}=\frac{1}{3}(3+1+2)=2$.

##(d)
Assign each observation to the centroid to which it is closest, in terms of Euclidean distance. Report the cluster labels for each observation.
```{r}
labels <- c(2,2,2,1,1,1)
plot(x[,1], x[,2], col = (labels + 1), pch = 16, cex = 2)
points(centroid_green[1], centroid_green[2], col = 2, pch = 6)
points(centroid_red[1], centroid_red[2], col = 3, pch = 6)
```


##(e)
Repeat (c) and (d) until the answers obtained stop changing.
```{r}
centroid1 <- c(mean(x[label == 1, 1]), mean(x[label == 1, 2]))
centroid2 <- c(mean(x[label == 2, 1]), mean(x[label == 2, 2]))
plot(x[,1], x[,2], col = (label + 1), pch = 16, cex = 2)
points(centroid1[1], centroid1[2], col = 2, pch = 6)
points(centroid2[1], centroid2[2], col = 3, pch = 6)

labels <- c(2,2,2,1,1,1)
plot(x[,1], x[,2], col = (labels + 1), pch = 16, cex = 2)
points(centroid1[1], centroid1[2], col = 2, pch = 6)
points(centroid2[1], centroid2[2], col = 3, pch = 6)
```
The algorithm is terminated at this step.

##(f)
In your plot from (a), color the observations according to the cluster labels obtained.
```{r}
plot(x[, 1], x[, 2], col = (labels + 1), pch = 16, cex = 2)
```

### 12.5
In words, describe the results that you would expect if you performed K-means clustering of the eight shoppers in Figure 12.16, on the basis of their sock and computer purchases, with K = 2. Give three answers, one for each of the variable scalings displayed. Explain.

If we take into consideration the unscaled variables, the number of socks plays a larger role than the number of computers, so we have the clusters{1,2,7,8}(least socks and computer) and {3,4,5,6}(more socks and computer).
```{r}
socks <- c(8, 11, 7, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8)
computers <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)
x <- cbind(socks, computers)
labels <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)
plot(x[, 1], x[, 2], col = (labels + 1), pch = 16, cex = 2, asp = 1)
```

### 12.8
In Section 12.2.3, a formula for calculating PVE was given in Equation 12.10. We also saw that the PVE can be obtained using the sdev output of the prcomp() function.
On the USArrests data, calculate PVE in two ways:
##(a)
Using the sdev output of the prcomp() function, as was done in Section 12.2.3.

##(b)
By applying Equation 12.10 directly. That is, use the prcomp() function to compute the principal component loadings. Then, use those loadings in Equation 12.10 to obtain the PVE.

### 12.9
Consider the USArrests data. We will now perform hierarchical clustering on the states.
##(a)
Using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean distance, cluster the states.

##(b)
Cut the dendrogram at a height that results in three distinct clusters. Which states belong to which clusters?

##(c)
Hierarchically cluster the states using complete linkage and Euclidean distance, after scaling the variables to have standard deviation one.

##(d)
What effect does scaling the variables have on the hierarchical clustering obtained? In your opinion, should the variables be scaled before the inter-observation dissimilarities are computed?
Provide a justification for your answer.

### 12.10
In this problem, you will generate simulated data, and then perform PCA and K-means clustering on the data.
##(a)
Generate a simulated data set with 20 observations in each of three classes (i.e. 60 observations total), and 50 variables.

##(b)
Perform PCA on the 60 observations and plot the first two principal component score vectors. Use a different color to indicate the observations in each of the three classes. If the three classes appear separated in this plot, then continue on to part (c). If not, then return to part (a) and modify the simulation so that there is greater separation between the three classes. Do not continue to part (c) until the three classes show at least some separation in the first two principal component score vectors.

##(c)
Perform K-means clustering of the observations with K = 3.How well do the clusters that you obtained in K-means clustering compare to the true class labels?

##(d)
Perform K-means clustering with K = 2. Describe your results.

##(e)
Now perform K-means clustering with K = 4, and describe your results.

##(f)
Now perform K-means clustering with K = 3 on the first two principal component score vectors, rather than on the raw data.That is, perform K-means clustering on the 60 Ã— 2 matrix of which the first column is the first principal component score vector, and the second column is the second principal component score vector. Comment on the results.

##(g)
Using the scale() function, perform K-means clustering with K = 3 on the data after scaling each variable to have standard deviation one. How do these results compare to those obtained in (b)? Explain.
