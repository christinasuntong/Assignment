### 12.3
In this problem, you will perform K-means clustering manually, with K = 2, on a small example with n = 6 observations and p = 2 features. The observations are as follows.

![my answer](/Users/christinasun/Desktop/MA679/Assignment/12.3.png)

##(a)
Plot the observations.

##(b)
Randomly assign a cluster label to each observation. You can use the sample() command in R to do this. Report the cluster labels for each observation.

##(c)
Compute the centroid for each cluster.

##(d)
Assign each observation to the centroid to which it is closest, in terms of Euclidean distance. Report the cluster labels for each observation.

##(e)
Repeat (c) and (d) until the answers obtained stop changing.

##(f)
In your plot from (a), color the observations according to the cluster labels obtained.
